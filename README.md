# To-Do List
A to-do list app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript provides a simple yet effective way to manage tasks and stay organized. This application allows users to add tasks dynamically, ensuring they can keep track of all their to-dos in one place. Each task entered is displayed with a delete button, allowing the users to remove them from the list completely when the task is done. The use of JavaScript ensures that the list is interactive and updates in real-time without the need for reloading the page. CSS is employed to style the app, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate. Users can add tasks with a simple input field and button, enhancing user experience with a clean and intuitive interface. Deleting tasks upon completion helps in maintaining a clutter-free list, making it easier to focus on pending tasks.
